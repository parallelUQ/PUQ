Examples
~~~~~~~~

These examples replicate the results from Sürer’s (2024) paper 'Simulation Experiment Design for Calibration via Active Learning'.


Instructions for running the illustrative examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To replicate Figures~1--4, respectively:

1)Go to the ``examples/JQT2024`` directory.

2)Execute the followings from the command line::

 python3 Figure1.py
 python3 Figure2.py
 python3 Figure3.py
 python3 Figure4.py

Running each script should not take more than 60 sec. See the figures (png files) saved under the directory.

Instructions for running one of the prominent empirical results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions are provided to replicate the first two panels in Figure~6.

To replicate, execute the following from the command line::

 python3 Figure5ab_sinf.py 

Running this script takes about 3hrs on a personal Mac laptop. 
Once completed, ``Figure5a.png`` and ``Figure5b.png`` are saved under the directory.
