We provide a collection of examples in this directory to demonstrate the usage of PUQ. Some of these examples reproduce results from our papers. 

The available examples include:

* `Technometrics2024 </examples/Technometrics2024>`_ : These examples replicate the results from the paper `Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design for Calibration of Expensive Simulation Models <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2023.2246157?src=&journalCode=utch20>`_ by Sürer, Plumlee, and Wild (2024).

* `JQT2024 </examples/JQT2024>`_ : These examples reproduce the results from Sürer’s (2024) paper `Simulation Experiment Design for Calibration via Active Learning  <https://doi.org/10.1080/00224065.2024.2391780>`_ .

* `NeurIPS2024 </examples/NeurIPS2024>`_ : These examples replicate results from the paper 'An Active Learning Performance Model for Parallel Bayesian Calibration of Expensive Simulations' by Sürer and Wild (2024).

* `Technometrics2025 </examples/Technometrics2025>`_ : These examples replicate the results from the paper `Batch Sequential Experimental Design for Calibration of Stochastic Simulation Models <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2025.2520860>`_ by Sürer (2025).
