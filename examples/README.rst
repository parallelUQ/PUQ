We provide examples in this directory to illustrate the usage of PUQ. 

Some of these examples replicate results presented in our papers. 

The following examples are available:

* `Technometrics2024 </examples/Technometrics2024>`_ : These examples replicate the results presented in the paper titled `Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design for Calibration of Expensive Simulation Models <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.2023.2246157?src=&journalCode=utch20>`_ by Sürer, Plumlee, and Wild (2024).

* `JQT2024 </examples/JQT2024>`_ :

* `IJOC2024+ </examples/IJOC2024+>`_ : These examples replicate the results presented in the paper titled 'Performance Analysis of Sequential Experimental Design for Calibration in Parallel Computing Environments' by Sürer and Wild (2024).

* `fresco_example </examples/fresco_example>`_ : This example demonstrates  the usage of PUQ with a physics reaction code `fresco`.
